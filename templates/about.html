        <p class="lead">Hello! I'm Reza, a mechatronics engineer driven by a fascination with how intelligent systems interact with the physical world.</p>
        <p>My journey began in mechanical engineering, where I built a strong foundation in the principles of dynamics, materials, and design. However, my curiosity always pulled me toward the "brains" behind the machinery. This led me to pursue a Master's degree in Mechatronics at Sharif University, where I now explore the exciting convergence of mechanics, electronics, and computer science.</p>
        
        <h3 class="mt-5">My Core Interests</h3>
        <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>ü§ñ Robotics:</strong> From kinematic analysis to developing autonomous navigation, I am passionate about creating robots that can perceive and act upon their environment.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>üß† Artificial Intelligence & ML:</strong> I am captivated by the power of machine learning to solve complex problems. I have hands-on experience through projects and certifications, including Harvard's CS50AI.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>‚öôÔ∏è Control Systems:</strong> Designing robust controllers that ensure stability and optimal performance is a challenge I thoroughly enjoy. It's the essential link between the digital brain and the physical body of a machine.</li>
            <li class="list-group-item"><strong>üíª Computers & Programming:</strong> I see programming as the ultimate tool for creation. My skills in Python and other languages allow me to bring theoretical ideas to life, whether it's a simulation or a functional web application like this one.</li>
